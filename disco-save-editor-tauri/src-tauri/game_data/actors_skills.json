    "long_description": "COOL FOR: ACROBATS. THIEVES. UNBEARABLE SHOW-OFFS.\n\nSavoir Faire urges you to be better than you are: it urges you to be disco. Slip by others in Samaran boxing style, then tumble out the back with unexpected acrobatics. It enables you to move with silent footsteps, to groove to a good beat, and to lift useful evidence off perps without them noticing. It also makes you a cooler cop, whose athletic flair will certainly impress the citizenry.\n\nAt high levels, Savoir Faire will make you the King of Cool – which is as much to say, the most stylish douchebag in Revachol. Nobody will see you until you’re ready to be seen; and then, they’ll get the full treatment, whether they want it or not. At low levels, however, you’ll be a bumbling, feckless cop unable to catch a pair of keys thrown by your partner without losing an eye.",

    "long_description": "COOL FOR: MACHINISTS. TINKERERS. INSTRUMENT PLAYERS.\n\nInterfacing wants you to connect to machines: to use and improve them, because that makes you a better human organism. It enables you to understand interactions with machines – be that how to repair the motor of a Kineema motor carriage, how to analyze the way a suspect used a pen, or how to re-figure electrical circuits. It even lets you steal keys off a keyring without being noticed.\n\nAt high levels, Interfacing will isolate you from society – why bother with people when you can talk to machines? And why bother with things like money when you can just pocket that display sandwich? At low levels, however, you will have a crucial part of the world cut off from you. People use machines to commit crimes all the time – if you can’t understand how a crime was accomplished, how can you solve it?",

It enables you to put up a strong front. It keeps your emotions hidden from the world and helps you to read the body language of others – to sense the cracks in their own composure. As well, it keeps you looking good while you do it. You’ll rock that disco outfit a lot more if you don’t slouch.\n\nAt high levels, Composure makes you tuck your gut in and maintain a stern expression. Even lying in bed, late night when no one else can see you, you’ll have to keep it up. You’ll never be able to stop. With low Composure, though, you’ll always be the first to crack. Every cop’s got a point when all that fear and rage comes spilling out – and the ones who unleash it don’t stay on the force much longer. Perhaps worse still, you won’t even make the ranks of Fashion Police.",

However, with low levels, you are going to miss out on everything. After all, you can’t arrest what you can’t see, hear, or smell.",
